# FFT-Spectrum-Analyzer-Matlab-GUI
This project is the course project of 'CIE 442- Digital Signal Processing'
This course is offered in the 2nd year Communication and Information Engineering Program - Uinversity of Science and Technology, Zewail City, Egypt.

The project is about a Matlab GUI application enables the user to view the signals' properties in the frequency domain with many 
different options and methods.
All the functions used is desinged by me according to what I learned during the course CIE 442. 
In addition, the function performs FFT is created manualy, it can perform Generic FFT to any signal whose length is 2^n where n is integer.
